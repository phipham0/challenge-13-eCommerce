# challenge-13-eCommerce

## Description

This project is used to challenge myself for creating api routes, seeding a schema in mysql, and models to navigate ORM. Through Insomnia, the user should be able to make get all, get by ID, update, push, and delete calls using the api routes.

This project was challenging more than fun because it is purely backend work. Although, working through it all has made me more comfortable with working with ORMS.

## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository onto your PC.
Create a .env file and insert:
DB_NAME='ecommerce_db'
DB_USER=''
DB_PW=''
Run npm install in the command line
Source the schema in mysql, then run the seeds using "npm run seeds"
To run the server, type "npm server.js"
Now api calls in Insomnia can be tested.
